Class 2

Will be using primarily command line by end

Jupyter vs Text editor:

Jupyter is a teaching tool
spyder is an 'interactive user interface'
  so are matlab and R studio - write code run
  it and see diagrams all in same space

specificity is good for *you* too. 'easy to forget
  what you've done'. be systematically communcative
  eg. what outliers u removed

'measurable' = literally OR subjectively (eg., marketing),
  aim for specificity
